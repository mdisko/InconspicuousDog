# Dark Sun
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2022

## Theme
In order to match the theme we decided to go with a sort of survival horror where the goal is to find your dinner. Our main concept was that the character in the game is experiencing his form of “dinner time”. We opted to make it horror themed so that we could incorporate more functions and we could add in a hunger bar to further the idea that this game is about finding dinner. 

## Game Play
Dark Sun is a free to play survival horror game that continuously challenges its players through a variety of methods. Set in the darkness of the polar night you must keep yourself from starving in the vast wilderness. With only a lantern and quick thinking the player must find their dinner before the cold takes over.
